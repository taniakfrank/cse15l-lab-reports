LAB REPORT 1
CD
![Image](cdSectionLab1.PNG)
1. no argument, working directory was simply the repository because i was working within there, because there was no argument the directory was never changed because i didnt tell the program what directory to switch to, this is not an error!
2. run w directory, when the command was run i changed the directory from simply the repository to lecture1, my output was that i was working within the lecture1 directory as evidenced by my next command line. this makes sense because id told the program to work within the lecture1 directory, this is not an error!
3. run w file, it was within the lecture1 directory when i tried to run w Hello.java, then i changed directory to messages and tried to run the txt files. i got the error outputs because i passed in a file name as arguments, but you can't work within a file and that argument isn't accepted for the cd command (literally tells you it changes to a directory), so this is an error!

LS

1. no argument, i was in the messages directory when i ran this so the output was a list of the text files with "hello world" in a couple different languages because those were the files within the messages directory, and the ls command lists the contents in a directory, so this is not an error!
2. directory,
